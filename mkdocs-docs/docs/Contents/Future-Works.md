As the QKD Simulation Platform continues to evolve, the following enhancements are planned for future releases:

- **SDK Version**:  
  We aim to develop a Software Development Kit (SDK) version of the application, allowing developers and researchers to easily integrate QKD simulation capabilities into their own tools and pipelines.

- **Support for Additional Protocols**:  
  Expanding beyond DPS and CoW, we plan to include more QKD protocols such as **BB84**, enabling broader experimentation and analysis across use cases.
